### Criteria for Recommendation
The recommended list I've compiled is a relatively small collection of vendors that have great reputations, offer in-demand certifications specific to the tech industry, and are readily available for aspiring students with smaller budgets and no privileged access.

#### Relevant
The vendors I have selected offer tech certifications made for tech professionals. We are never punished for learning something highly technical, even if it isn't directly applicable to our current or desired job function. In this industry, everything is connected. We are not better off for only knowing a small slice of it.

Some things that I've completely omitted from this site are programming and design certifications. I don't think that certification is worth it when it comes to coding and design. I would instead focus on building projects and putting together a solid professional portfolio. 

#### Available
Some certification vendors do not make their certification process generally available to the public. Remember that just because we might be able to sign up for a certification exam, it does not mean that we can access the vendor's training materials to best prepare for it. I consider a vendor to be restrictive if their training is extremely expensive, unavailable in a self-paced format of any kid, or only available to corporate customers or users with a verified corporate email address.

#### Prevalent
Some certification vendors provide commercial products that hold a smaller market share or are not positioned favorably on [**Gartner's Magic Quadrant**](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/magic-quadrants-research){:target="_blank"} for their respective market segments. This also includes certification vendors that offer products with no significant competition, but are also not widely adopted in the industry.

#### Reputable
What about certification vendors that do not offer commercial products? There's an abundance of organizations that offer certification and training as their main product. Prevalence doesn't apply here very much, but reputation does. The vendors that I've included in this list are established and trusted.

### Recommended Certification Vendors
If you are new to the industry and want to break in or if you want to upgrade your tech career in the most direct way, then I would recommend starting with the vendors below.

#### Cybersecurity:
- [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/certifications){:target="_blank"}
- [ISACA](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/certifications){:target="_blank"}
- [ISC2](https://www.isc2.org/certifications){:target="_blank"}
- [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/){:target="_blank"}

#### DevOps:
- [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/){:target="_blank"}
- [GitLab](https://university.gitlab.com/pages/certifications){:target="_blank"}
- [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification){:target="_blank"}
- [Mirantis](https://training.mirantis.com/certification/dca-certification-exam/){:target="_blank"}

#### Platforms:
- [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/){:target="_blank"}
- [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html){:target="_blank"}
- [Google](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification){:target="_blank"}
- [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/){:target="_blank"}

### Other Certification Vendors
They can be further broken down into four distinct categories based on why they did not make the recommended list.

#### Adjacent
Vendors that offer certification opportunities for things that I do not consider to be entirely relevant for most tech pros. The focus for them is mostly on business analysis, CRM, process, GRC, and management. For anyone looking to shift gears and potentially move into something more business-related or process-related, these could help.
#### Niche
These vendors offer certification opportunities for rather specific products within the industry. That alone does not mean that we should disregard them. For some of us, these could be much more relevant than anything I have on the _Recommended_ _Certification_ _Vendors_. Some of these vendors also make their certification process rather restrictive, but I did not want to include them in the __Restrictive__ category as those vendors offer certification opportunities for widely adapted technologies.
#### Obscure
By obscure, I more mean "relatively obscure". These vendors are not complete unknowns. That being said, their certification programs are less notable than the vendors on the _Recommended_ _Certification_ _Vendors_ list. Some of these will probably move up at some point. There's a limit to just how many cybersecurity certification vendors can be at the top. It will be tough displacing CompTIA, ISC2, ISACA, OffSec, and albeit rather pricey GIAC.
#### Restrictive
Includes vendors that either restrict their training materials to corporate accounts, do not offer self-paced learning options, or make the training materials unaffordable for the average student. I would put almost all of these somewhere on the _Recommended_ _Certification_ _Vendors_ list if they made their training materials and certification opportunities more available.

Remember, this doesn't mean that they aren't worth it! You should always draw out your own long-term education plans based on where you want your own career to go.

### Final Words
There is so much more to being a successful tech professional than accumulating certifications. Obviously, I think they are valuable overall, but what really matters is whether or not we can do our jobs well. Not all of the skills we need to know can be measured with certifications. It is imperative that we work on our soft skills. Being personable is often more valuable than being certified.
 
I had never heard of many of these vendors before starting this website. Every month I'll probably discover a new one. Because I want to create as definitive of a list as I can, I will only exclude vendors that are objectively bad. That being said, if you think I'm excluding one that belongs on this list, let me know! It's likely not intentional. My LinkedIn profile is linked in the footer. 

Regarding the categorization above, all of this is nothing more than my opinion. Feel free to create your own list based off of your own preferences and criteria. Hopefully this is helpful in getting you started.
