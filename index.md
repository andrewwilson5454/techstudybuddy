### Welcome to Tech Study Buddy!
This is a project that I started several months after I made a goal to earn several certifications relevant to my job as a cloud engineer.

I knew about the big names in tech certification such as Cisco, Microsoft, AWS, ISC2, CompTIA, and so on.

I knew a lot less about the endless number of certification vendors that I came across as I kept diving deeper. It was overwhelming trying to wrap my head around it.

This site aims to simplify the modern tech certification landscape, providing a helpful guide for those looking to enhance their skills.

### Unlike Any Other Industry
There is no other industry out there that allows someone at the very bottom of the proverbial totem pole and at the very beginning of their career to excel so quickly. Certifications provide a structured path towards learning specific technical concepts. The more certifications we achieve, the more opportunities will become available.

In tech, we are limited only by ourselves. Anyone can become an expert engineer. It just takes motivation and discipline. If you have those two things in abundance, then hopefully this website can serve as a helpful reference for your certification journey. 

Good luck, and thanks for visiting!
