### Welcome to Tech Study Buddy!
My name is Andrew Wilson, and thank you for visiting my personal site!

In addition to hosting a simple blog, I have compiled a rather massive list of tech certification vendors. This site aims to simplify the modern tech certification landscape, providing a helpful guide for those looking to enhance their skills.

I'm also writing up quick reviews of the certifications that I personally passed, where I'll talk about things like prep time, study materials, and my thoughts on the exam.

### Unlike Any Other Profession
In tech, we are limited only by ourselves. Anyone can become an expert engineer. It just takes motivation and discipline. Tech certifications provide a structured path towards learning specific technical skills. Master enough in-demand skills, and opportunities for career success will be in abundance.

Good luck, and please reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have any questions!
