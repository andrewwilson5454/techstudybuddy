### About This Site
Within just minutes of diving in to which certifications would help level up my skills as new cloud engineer, I was completely overwhelmed with how many sites promised to help me reach my goals. It felt like nothing more than a cash grab. Unfortunately, this isn't far from the truth. 

I knew a bit about certifications before making my 2024 New Year's resolution focused on elevating my career. Not just tech, but many industry certifications related to human resources, finance, and so on. Not all of them exist just to turn a profit. There is real value in getting certified in various tech skills, but it requires a bit of research.

That's where Tech Study Buddy comes in. I've spent days sorting through over a hundred certification vendors. I've compared the applicable costs, potential restrictions, legitimate controversies, and market trends to come up with a relatively definitive list of the best certification vendors available to us right now.

At a time when information technology has never been more relevant, it's also never been more important for us to develop our tech skills. This site will hopefully provide a meaningful roadmap to help you along with the way.

### About Andrew
I am a tech professional who has been in the industry since graduating from the University of North Georgia in December 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems. I began my career in the spring of 2017 at a data center in the Atlanta metro area.

Since then, I met my future wife, moved to New York City, moved back to Atlanta, got married, bought a house in Spartanburg, and tackled multiple landscaping projects with her. It's been a busy, turbulent time. But things are pretty steady now. 

At the beginning of 2024 and for the first time since graduating from college, I felt that I finally had the stability and time to dedicate towards knocking out all of these certifications that have been piling up in my browser bookmarks.

If you ever have any questions about anything to do with tech jobs, certifications, or whatever, please reach out to me on LinkedIn. I would be pleased to help answer any questions.

Thanks for stopping by!
